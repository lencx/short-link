# Short Link

> Link shortener

## Getting Started

### Install in One Click (for Free)

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Flencx%2Fshort-link&project-name=short-link&repository-name=short-link)

After the deployment is complete, try to access the root path. If it works, it will redirect to [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/lencx)
